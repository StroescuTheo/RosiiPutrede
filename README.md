**Act I:** The PROBLEM!

As we are all pretty decent movie buffs, we found a need to find reviews made for our favorite upcoming movies. Unfortunately, the main sources of these reviews are foreign websites, like Metacritic and, of course, Rotten Tomatoes. Our critics do not have a proper outlet to voice their opinions and reviews about movies. This includes Romanian made films, or even plays, or concerts which are rarely, if ever, covered on these existing websites. We feel that local critics are not represented properly and that they need an outlet which can gather their views, package them in a nice form and distribute them to the masses. Our future ketchup makers need a voice, so we want to give it to them!

**Act II:** The Solution?

FADE IN: Exterior, night, the road between the cinema and the subway station.

<HTML>The main characters discuss the most recent cinematic venture they have watched and are, of course, arguing about what it all meant. During this discussion they realize they cannot find any local sources to settle their qualms. At this moment the decision appears: "We're gonna make our own review website! With Romanian critics and grading system!" <img src="https://adiumxtras.com/images/pictures/futuramas_bender_dock_icon_1_8169_3288_image_4129.png" alt="Bender" style="width:25px;height:25px;"> </HTML>

FADE OUT.

Joking aside, we believe that an outlet to all the Romanian critics out there is sorely needed and while some other sites offer half a solution, we want to make a designated review website. Our inspiration, as the name implies, is rottentomatoes.com, a US based website which aggregates critic reviews from all over the Internet and settles on a score for the movie, based on their grades. We want to use a similar grading system, meaning having separate critic and user review ratings, as a normal user's experience of a movie might be different from what a critic might find outstanding about a movie. 

The ultimate result we want to reach is having a proper website which can be used as a two-way platform for critics and movie distributors to use in order to get the people's opinion out to the public. Usually, not everyone uses sites like Rotten Tomatoes properly, by not understanding the grading system. For second language English users, or for people that are not as informed, having someone's opinion, especially one that speaks the same language could be helpful. We will make use of a system of approval for critics and user reviewers as well, in order to get an average that can speak to anyone wanting to see a movie in the cinema and having a hard time to make a decision.

The website is the starting point for this project and we hope to collaborate with as many certified people that we can find and maybe even advance in other areas, such as theatre, music and art shows.

**Introducing the supporting cast:** The Consumers

Our main target audience is represented by the key demographic: 14-35. The cinema scene has had a huge boom in popularity in the last few years and people have started consuming movies more and more on a weekly basis, some even more often than that. Most of the people in this demographic use the Internet daily so the easiest access to the information we want to put out is through this website.

**Act III:** The Competition.

The main competition we have identified on this market is the site Cinemagia.ro which is similar to IMdb.com, the Internet Movie Database, which is more of a collection of information about the movie itself, given by the producers and distributors. This site does feature a review tab, but it is mostly a single review per movie site, as it does not use an aggregate grading system as the one we intend to use.

**The deus ex-machina:** 

The advantage we have over our competition is a much greater focus on the reviews of movies, instead of just offering basic information. Also, we plan to have a bit of fun with the language and approaches to the consumers, as we have found that, most of the times, people come in for the fun and then stay for the information.

FADE TO BLACK.

**The Budget:**

The main assets we need to invest in are:
  *Computers
  *Hosting
  *Software
  *Office space
  *Additional expenses(for tomatoes, mostly)

**The Revenue:**

Tomatoes are far from a sustainable source of nourishment, so we will use advertisements and affiliations in order to fund ourselves and provide great content to people as fast and as clean as they need it. This means contacting industry specific advertising companies and affiliating ourselves with publishers, movie blogs and all sort of movie related companies. We will offer exposure for them and their content in a fair and balanced fashion, while steering clear of favoritisms.

**The main audience:**
Any review is a good review when you want to reach as many people as you need to tell your message. But what if you want to reach the heart of that one person in the audience, grab hold of his feelings and make him experience your true message? Well firstly you'll need to figure out who this person is, right?

!!Casting call!!
Looking for any person aged 15 to 40, man or woman, that enjoys arts as a form of entertainment

Going with the **FLOW**


*Interior, night, User at his computer*

User[ voice over deep monologue(see if Morgan Freeman is available, if not use James) ]: Man, I wonder what is all the fuss with this movie called *The Post*. Hmmm maybe the internet will help. 

**Opens Browser**
Now, let me see.. what was that website those 2 from my school were always mumbling about...
3 snacks later..
Oh yeah! 

**Enters www.RosiiPutrede.ro** .. Weird name for a website. If I ever open my own website I'll call it *Puzzles*. Figuring out why, *is* the puzzle.
Ok, now.. 

**Clicks on Movie list**. Ah! That was fast, here it is. 

**Click on Movie details**. Ohhh.. it's Spielberg! Now I get it.. Wait.. was he the guy with the dinosaurs or with the spaceships. Eh, anyway.. Ok so it looks like I can see both some random user's review, or a professional critic's review. Well these critics are always too pretentious, so.. 

**Clicks on See User Reviews**.. Ah, this guy sums it up perfectly.. definitely going to see this movie next week
